[00:00.39] We all pretend to be the heroes on the good side
[00:06.34] [00:06.34] Oh-oh
[00:08.39] [00:08.39] Oh-oh-oh-oh
[00:10.67] [00:10.67] Oh-oh-whoa oh
[00:14.08] [00:14.08] Some things are written in black
[00:16.28] [00:16.28] Some things are written in white
[00:18.50] [00:18.50] You never bother with the other cutlers
[00:23.03] [00:23.03] You are the protagonist
[00:25.27] [00:25.27] She's the antagonist
[00:27.56] [00:27.56] Your black and white world is mundane and pointless
[00:32.06] [00:32.06] So many shades of gray
[00:34.72] [00:34.72] Oh how can you not understand what's so easy?
[00:39.44] [00:39.44] Oh good easily fades away
[00:44.92] [00:44.92] Think twice before you fall in love with me
[00:48.07] [00:48.07] Because
[00:48.71] [00:48.71] I'm a vilain
[00:50.55] [00:50.55] Do you think that it isn't true?

[00:57.23] [00:57.23] Oh no, you're a villain
[00:59.59] [00:59.59] Do you think that it isn't true?
[01:01.85] [01:01.85] Whenever you breathe out the villain in you breathes out too
[01:06.07] [01:06.07] You know I'm killing someone
[01:08.51] [01:08.51] Maybe you're killing someone
[01:10.89] [01:10.89] Maybe I'm killing you
[01:13.17] [01:13.17] Maybe you're killing me
[01:15.29] [01:15.29] Maybe
[01:16.42] [01:16.42] We all pretend to be the heroes on the good side
[01:20.91] [01:20.91] But what If we're the villains on the other?
[01:25.92] [01:25.92] Am I good, am I bad?
[01:27.29] [01:27.29] Ay
[01:27.96] [01:27.96] Are you good, are you bad?
[01:29.52] [01:29.52] Ay
[01:30.33] [01:30.33] Somebody that I love with all my heart
[01:31.85] [01:31.85] Could be somebody that another person hates
[01:33.80] [01:33.80] Ay
[01:34.71] [01:34.71] Are we good, are we bad?
[01:36.24] [01:36.24] Ay
[01:37.00] [01:37.00] What is good, what is bad?
[01:38.44] [01:38.44] Ay
[01:39.52] [01:39.52] Somebody that you hate is still somebody that
[01:41.07] [01:41.07] A mother loves with her entire heart
[01:42.81] [01:42.81] Say

[02:29.05] [02:29.05] Oh no, we're all villains
[02:31.42] [02:31.42] Do you think that it isn't true?
